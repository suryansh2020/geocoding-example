Reverse Geocoding Example
=========================

There are many open data sets that can be used in a geospatial
analysis. A data set may not include coordinates by default
but you can use reverse geocoding to make them available.

Usage
-----

You will need to install dependencies (`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`),
and then run the example script (`$ python geocoding.py`).
